                <p>Hi, I'm <span>Kate Francis</span>! I attended Westwood Regional High School <br>and I am currently attending <span>Quinnipiac University</span> as a sophmore. <br>I first became interested in the computer science field when I <br> decided to take AP Computer Science in high school. I had so much <br>fun in that class and I did so well that I got a 5/5 on the AP test. <br>Currently, I am quite experienced in <span>Java</span> and have a good <br>understanding of <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>. My interests include collecting trading <br>cards, gaming, and cooking! My favorite music artist is Ado; I love her song All Night Radio.</p>
